# Dioxus JLPT Flashcards

This is a personal project built to practice Rust and the Dioxus framework by creating a desktop flashcard application for studying Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) vocabulary.

# Features
- Generate Flashcard Decks: Filter and create study sessions based on:
    - JLPT Level (N5 to N1)
    - Word Familiarity (words you know vs. words you need to practice)
    - Favorites (words you have personally starred)
- Interactive Flashcards:
    - ‚≠êÔ∏è Favorite: Hit the star icon to save a word for later review.
    - üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech: Hit the speaker button to hear the Japanese word pronounced by the system's native TTS engine.
    - ‚úÖ Got It: Mark a word as "familiar" to reduce its appearance frequency.
    - üîÑ Need More Practice: Keep a word as "unfamiliar" to ensure it appears more often.

# Getting Started

since I don't expect anyone use it, but if you do, 

1. install rust in your system, download the whole project, 
2. run `cargo run --bin build_db` to build the jlpt word database, 
3. then you can build the project.

# Tech Stack
This project is built with Rust and leverages the following core crates:

- [Dioxus](https://docs.rs/dioxus/latest/dioxus/index.html): A portable, performant, and ergonomic framework for building user interfaces in Rust.
- [SQLx](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/index.html): A modern, async-ready, and type-safe SQL toolkit for Rust. Used for the local flashcard database.
- [tts-rs](https://docs.rs/tts/latest/tts/): A cross-platform text-to-speech library that provides access to native system voices.
